Gomoku Strategy Playbook (for Humans & Bots)

Scope: Freestyle Gomoku on 15×15+ boards (rules: any 5+ in a row wins; no restrictions).
Fact you must know: freestyle is a first-player win with perfect play. That means:

As Black (first): A forced win exists. This guide shows you how to play for that result systematically.

As White (second): A guaranteed draw does not exist under freestyle. This guide gives you a max-resistance, mistake-punishing defense that converts to wins when Black slips.
If you require a theoretical draw guarantee as White, use Renju/Swap2 opening rules (outside the scope of freestyle).

0) Notation, Primitives, and Pattern Glossary

Board coordinates

Use 0-indexed Cartesian: center is (0,0); right is +x; up is +y. Symmetry handling becomes trivial in code.

Symbols

B = Black stone; W = White stone; . = empty.

Directions D ∈ {→, ←, ↑, ↓, ↗, ↘, ↖, ↙} as (dx,dy) unit vectors.

Threat patterns (attacker’s perspective)

5: five in a row → win.

4o (open four): ._BBBB_. → win next unless blocked immediately.

4c (closed four): one end blocked (e.g., WBBBB. or .BBBBW) → still forcing (must answer).

3o (open three): ._BBB_. → if unaddressed, upgrades to 4o; two concurrent 3o is lethal (fork).

3c (closed three): blocked on one side (e.g., WBBB_.) → weaker but still useful in forcing chains.

b3 (broken three): discontinuous 3 that becomes 3o in one move (e.g., ._BB.B_.) → valuable as a pre-threat.

2+ (potential): shapes that become b3/3o in one move; use as scaffolding.

Priority of responses (defender’s perspective)

Block 5 (obvious).

Block 4o.

Answer 4c (usually).

Defuse double-threat creation (two 3o, or 3o+4c).

Prevent upgrades from b3 → 3o when it also creates a fork.

1) Core Ideas You’ll Use Everywhere

Tempo: Play forcing moves so the opponent has only one reply; chain these until a fork (two wins) appears.

Forks: The decisive motifs are double-three (two 3o) and double-four (two 4 threats).

Threat-Space Search (TSS): Limit calculation to moves that create/answer threats (3/4/5). This is how engines prove wins efficiently.

Zone of Relevance: Generate moves within distance ≤2 from existing stones (expands if board is sparse).

Symmetry: Treat rotations/reflections as identical; hash canonicalized positions.

2) Black (First Player) — Forced-Win Framework
Phase A — Opening Scaffold (Moves 1–5)

A1. B1: Place at center (0,0).
A2. Expand on two orthogonal axes to prepare multi-line potential (keep stones within radius 2–3).

Heuristic: aim to create at least one b3 in two directions by move 4.

Avoid early edges/corners; center maximizes branching.

A3. If W mirrors or plays nearby, stay central and build toward the first 3o:

Template aim by ~move 5: one line with ._BBB_. or a position that becomes 3o in one move while you also threaten another line.

Bot rule (opening):

if can_make_3o(): do it
else create b3 that also prepares a perpendicular b3
ensure every move either (i) builds the first 3o, or (ii) prepares a backup b3 in another direction

Phase B — First Forcing Cycle (Moves 6–12)

Goal: Convert first 3o → 4 forcing sequence while seeding a second 3o elsewhere.

B1. Make/maintain a 3o.

If W ignores → upgrade to 4o → win next.

If W blocks at one end (turning it 3c), you play to:

either restore 3o (extending opposite end),

or drop a new b3/3o on a perpendicular line.

B2. Create a 4c forcing move when it grants a free tempo to build the second 3o:

Pattern idea:

(line D1): W BBBB .
           ^--- 4c (forcing)


While W is compelled to block the open end, your next move upgrades your perpendicular b3 → 3o.

B3. After W answers your 4c, you now have:

Existing pressure on D1 (often still dangerous), plus

A fresh 3o on D2. Continue:

B4. Force to a fork:

From the D2 3o, play the move that simultaneously:

upgrades it toward 4, and

revives pressure on D1 (often by forming another 3o there).

Within 1–3 forcing plies you should reach double-three or 3+4 fork, then double-four.

Bot rule (forcing cycle):

loop:
  if immediate 5: play and win
  elif any 4o: play it (forces single reply); then search fork
  elif can create 4c that compels a reply AND unlocks 3o elsewhere next: do it
  else create second 3o (or b3->3o) on perpendicular
  if two concurrent 3o exist: next move aims at double-four

Phase C — Converting the Fork (Moves 10–20)

C1. Double-three present?

Play the intersection that converts either 3o into 4o while leaving the other 3o alive → W can block only one line → you win next.

C2. 3+4 fork?

If you have a 4c/4o on one line and 3o on another, make 4o on the 3o line. W must block; you finish on the 4 line.

C3. Double-four?

If you can place a move creating two distinct 4s, you win next no matter what W does.

Safety invariant for Black:

Never play a non-forcing move once you’ve started a forcing cycle.

If a move isn’t (i) 5, (ii) 4o, (iii) 4c with a follow-up unlock, or (iv) creating a second 3o, don’t play it.

3) White (Second Player) — Maximum-Resistance Defense

Reminder: In freestyle, White cannot force a draw versus perfect Black. Your goal is to break forcing chains, avoid symmetrical traps, and counter-threat whenever safely possible to push Black off the “proven” path and win on errors.

Phase D — Early Neutralization (Moves 1–6)

D1. Contest the center immediately (adjacent to Black’s first stone).
D2. Mirror carefully for 1–2 moves max, then break symmetry (mirroring too long gives Black an easy fork framework).
D3. Deny open threes:

When Black threatens to form ._BBB_., pre-block one end to enforce 3c, ideally at a square that also prevents perpendicular scaffolding.

Bot rule (early defense):

if B can form 3o in 1 move: pre-block the most central end that also kills perpendicular b3
else place a central stone that intersects the highest number of B's growth lines

Phase E — Breaking Forcing Chains (Moves 7–15)

E1. Versus 4o: Always block the win point.
E2. Versus 4c: Usually block the open end, unless you have a strong counter-threat (your own 4o) that forces Black to answer you first.
**E3. Prevent double-three:

If Black has one 3o, block the intersection that also prevents the second 3o (look for “junction” squares that kill both directions).

If two 3o are inevitable, prefer a block that transforms one into 3c and reduces the other to b3.

E4. Counter-threat when safe:

If a single move can both (i) block Black’s threat and (ii) create your own 4o or 3o, pick it—this steals tempo.

E5. Avoid self-traps:

Don’t place blocks that assist Black in forming a 4c with tempo.

Avoid giving Black a “build-while-you-block” square.

Bot rule (threat trade):

if must-answer by you and must-answer by Black both exist:
   prefer moves that satisfy your defense and create a new must-answer for Black
else:
   prioritize killing fork creation (two 3o) over neutralizing a single 3c

Phase F — Turning Defense into Attack (Moves 15+)

F1. As Black’s pressure dilutes (after you break a forcing cycle), immediately claim center lanes and build your own 3o.
F2. Prefer asymmetric forks (diagonal + orthogonal), harder for Black to parry simultaneously.
F3. If Black overextends on one flank, counter on the opposite flank to race to first 4o.

4) Common Local Templates (with Explanations)

Below, x is the target move.

T1. Grow 3o then fork (Black)
Line D1:   . B B . B .
Goal:      . B B B B .   (play x = fill the gap)
Result:    4o forcing; while W answers, prepare a 3o on D2


If W plays at either end first, you play the other end → 3o restored.

Next, create b3/3o on D2, aim for two 3o.

T2. 4c as a tempo lever (Black)
W B B B B .
^           x here makes 4c


W must fill the open end → you immediately upgrade your prepared b3 on D2 to 3o, heading to fork.

T3. Junction block (White)
Black threats on D1 and D2 share a junction ‘x’:
   D2
   |
---x---  D1
   |


Playing x often kills both upgrades (turns potential 3o into 3c or b3). Always search for shared junctions.

T4. Counter-threat block (White)
Before: Black threatens 4o at p
Move:   White plays q that both prevents p and creates own 4o
Outcome: Black must answer White now (tempo stolen)

5) Endgame Conversions

Black

Once a fork is available, pick the line that maximizes disjoint win points (so a single White block can’t parry both).

Prefer double-four over double-three if both exist; it gives immediate mate-in-1 next.

White

In late defense, count liberties of each line (empty endpoints). Always block the line with fewest remaining parries (usually 4o).

If multiple 4o are looming, block the one that also removes opponent’s ability to create another 4o next turn (look for “bridge” points).

6) Implementation Guide (for a Strong Bot)
A. Search Framework

Two modes:

Threat-Space Search (TSS) when any 3/4/5 exists (fast, proof-oriented).

MTD(f)/Negamax with iterative deepening in quiet positions; horizon guarded by quiescence that dives until no 3/4 exist.

Move ordering (critical):

Immediate 5

Create 4o / block 4o

Create 4c / block 4c (only those with clean follow-ups)

Create second 3o (fork potential)

Upgrade b3 → 3o; kill opponent b3 → 3o upgrades

Other central tightening moves

Pruning & acceleration:

Transposition table (Zobrist hashing on 8 symmetries → store canonical form).

Killer moves/History heuristic.

Null-move only outside TSS (avoid zugzwang artifacts).

Selective generator: only cells within Chebyshev distance ≤2 from any stone, except immediate tactical replies.

B. Pattern Detector (bitboard-friendly)

Maintain 8 directional bitboards per side or 4 with both directions.

Precompute masks to scan for: 5, 4o, 4c, 3o, 3c, b3.

Return:

list of must-answer opponent threats

list of winning moves for side-to-move

set of junction cells (shared upgrades)

C. Evaluation (quiet nodes)

Score = weighted sum of pattern counts with side-to-move bonus:

score =  + INF * (#my5)
         - INF * (#opp5)
         + M4O  * (#my4o)  - O4O * (#opp4o)
         + M4C  * (#my4c)  - O4C * (#opp4c)
         + M3O  * (#my3o)  - O3O * (#opp3o)
         + M3C  * (#my3c)  - O3C * (#opp3c)
         + MB3  * (#myb3)  - OB3 * (#oppb3)
         + CENTER * (centrality delta)


Use asymmetric weights (defending a 4o is mandatory; overvalue opponent’s threats to avoid “pretty but losing” lines).

Add fork bonuses when two threats are independent (disjoint win points).

D. Tactical Policy (must be hard-coded)

If opponent has 4o: block it first, unless you can place 5 immediately.

If you can make double-four now → do it.

If you can create two 3o with one move → do it (and mark the node as winning in TSS).

When answering 4c, prefer blocks that also remove opponent’s ability to restore 3o elsewhere (junction preference).

E. Opening Book (practical)

Seed a small center-focused book (first 4–6 plies) with human-curated lines that:

build early b3/3o on orthogonal axes (for Black),

deny standard central forks and keep junction squares under White’s control (for White).

After book exits, fall back to TSS/ID search.

7) Step-By-Step Reference Trees (Templates)

(Coordinates are relative; rotate/reflect as needed.)

Black Tree B-1: Linear-to-Perpendicular Fork

B: (0,0)

W: any central adjacent

B: (1,0) — start line D1

W: contest near (2,0) or (−1,0)

B: (2,0) — threatens to form 3o next at (−1,0) or (3,0) depending on W

If W blocks end → 3c appears.

B: place b3 on D2, e.g., (0,1).

If W ignores D2:

B: upgrade b3→3o on D2.

W blocks D2 end →

B: make 4c on D1 (forcing).

W answers →

B: restore 3o on D2 (or create second 3o) → double-three imminent.

W can block one line →

B: create double-four → win next.

Black Tree B-2: Diagonal-Orthogonal Cross

B: (0,0)

W: nearby

B: (1,1)

W: nearby

B: (2,2) — diagonal scaffold

W: blocks diagonal end

B: (1,0) — orthogonal pivot → creates b3 both directions

W: parries one axis

B: upgrade b3→3o on the other axis

W: block end

B: 4c on diagonal (forcing)

W: answers

B: 3o maintained orthogonally → fork → convert to double-four.

White Tree W-1: Anti-Fork Central Net

B: (0,0)

W: (1,0)

B: (0,1)

W: (1,1) — maintain contact, prevent perpendicular b3

B: tries to elongate a line

W: play junction that denies 3o on one axis and b3 on the other (often the “gap” between Black’s two stones)

B: attempts 4c

W: block mandatory end unless you can make your 4o (rare but decisive)

Transition: as soon as a forcing cycle breaks, claim center lanes and build your own 3o.

8) Practical Checklist (Fast Reference)

As Black

 First move center; stay central until a live threat exists.

 Build one 3o and one b3 on different axes.

 Use 4c only when it buys time to upgrade the other axis.

 Aim for double-three → double-four → 5.

 Never play a non-forcing move once the cycle starts.

As White

 Block 4o instantly; usually answer 4c.

 Break double-three attempts at the junction square.

 Prefer blocks that also kill perpendicular upgrades.

 Counter-threat only when it also completes your defense.

 After defusing, seize center and build your own 3o.

9) What This Guarantees (and What It Doesn’t)

Black: The plan operationalizes the known forced-win via threat-space play: if you follow the forcing policy and your search proves forks correctly, you will force a win.

White: In freestyle, no perfect draw guarantee exists. The defense above maximally resists, breaks forcing chains often, and wins on inaccuracies.
